# Logistic Map and Chaos Exploration

This repository, found at [galenwilkerson/logistic_equation](https://github.com/galenwilkerson/logistic_equation), contains a Python notebook and scripts dedicated to exploring the logistic map. This project illustrates the transition from simple dynamics to complex, chaotic behavior in a fundamental nonlinear system.

## Overview

The logistic map is a key concept in chaos theory and nonlinear dynamics, representing how simple mathematical models can exhibit a range of behaviors from predictable to chaotic. This exploration is rooted in understanding these dynamics and their implications in natural systems.

## Contents

- `LogisticMap.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook that implements and visualizes the logistic map, highlighting its transition from steady-state to chaos as the growth rate parameter varies.

## Installation

To interact with the materials in this repository:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.6 or higher installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/galenwilkerson/logistic_equation.git
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies, ideally in a virtual environment:
   ```
   pip install matplotlib numpy
   ```

## Usage

After installation, navigate to the repository directory and start Jupyter Notebook:

```
jupyter notebook LogisticMap.ipynb
```

Inside the notebook, run the cells to see the logistic map's behavior and its transition into chaotic dynamics.

## Features

- Detailed visualization of the logistic map for various growth rate values.
- An exploration into the onset of chaos in a discrete dynamical system.
- Insights into bifurcation theory and its relevance in understanding complex systems.
